# Haskell Playground

This repository is a personal sandbox to test out and explore Haskell. It contains various experiments, exercises, and small projects to help me learn and practice the Haskell programming language.

## Overview

This repository is used to:

- Experiment with Haskell syntax and functional programming concepts
- Test out recursive functions and pattern matching
- Explore various Haskell libraries and tools
- Work on small, self-contained Haskell projects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Haskell and GHC installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using `ghcup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
ghcup install ghc
ghcup set ghc <version>
