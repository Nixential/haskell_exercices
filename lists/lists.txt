- All the elements of a list must be of the same type unlike tuples
[] -- empty list
[3,9,6] :: Int
[1 .. 10] -- Same as [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
[1, 3 .. 10] -- Same as [1,3,5,7,9]
in the previous example haskell takes the difference between the first two numbers (3 - 1) and keeps summing them until reaching the last number.

We can also have lists of tuples in haskell
* [(1, "One), (2, "Two")] -- [(Int, String)]

We can have a list of lists:
[[8], [3,4,5]] :: [[Int]]
